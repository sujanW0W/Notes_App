# Notes App

A simple note application for storing all your notes.
This application is built using **React** for UI, **Node js, Express js & MySQL** for server-side.

To run this project, follow these steps:

You must have installed and configured MySQL into your computer. If not, do download and install it.
Also, create an empty database.

1. npm install on both 'client' and 'server' folder to install all the dependencies required to run this project.
2. Create an .env file in the 'server' directory which will contain following variables:
    1. DB_NAME=[Name of the DB]
    2. DB_USER=[username of the DB]
    3. DB_HOST=[Hostname of the DB]
    4. DB_PASSWORD=[Password to your DB]
    5. JWT_SECRET=[Secret encryption key]
    6. JWT_LIFETIME=[timespan of the validity of the token]

After these steps, 'npm start' on both the directories.

You must log in into the application before creating notes. You can register.

Thank You!
Have a wonderful day!
